# Refresh uv.lock deliberately and apply it to the dev container's venv. This is the only routine
# way the lock changes: rebuilding the container never rewrites it (see README, "Updating
# dependencies").
#
# Usage: ./update-dependencies.sh [package...]
#   With no packages, every locked package moves to the newest version pyproject.toml allows.
#   With packages, only those move (plus whatever their new versions require), e.g. yt-dlp, or
#   pathlib-extensions to bump its git commit.
#
# uv prints each version change. Afterwards review `git diff uv.lock`, run the gates, and commit
# pyproject.toml and uv.lock together; the image picks up the new lock on its next build.
#
# Runs from the repository root wherever it is invoked from, and talks to PyPI directly: a lock
# resolved through the PYPI_PROXY mirror would record the mirror's URLs (DESIGN.md, "Dependencies
# are locked and installed with uv").
