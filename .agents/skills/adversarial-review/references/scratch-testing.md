# Scratch Testing Recipe

Use this recipe when the [review procedure](../SKILL.md#procedure) requires scratch execution. It supplies examples, not a substitute for AGENTS' test-ownership rules.

Create a scratch copy only when writable execution is needed. Within one agent's assessment of a fixed candidate, reuse one owned scratch tree for focused checks and mutants where practical, restoring the candidate before each mutation and using fresh test processes. Do not share a writable scratch tree between agents. A new assessment must use its current candidate; changing import-lifecycle requirements may justify a separate copy. Evidence inspection alone needs no scratch copy.

Run fresh Python processes from the prepared scratch root using `python -m pytest`, with `PYTHONPATH` pointing to that root and `TMPDIR` plus pytest's `--basetemp` inside an owned scratch subdirectory. Preserve the copied `tests/conftest.py` configuration bootstrap. Add scratch-only provenance checks in the process exercising the code without changing application import timing; a separate `find_spec` probe does not certify the pytest process. For focused tests whose exercised modules remain loaded, prefer checking `sys.modules` after execution. Add the following example only to the scratch copy of `tests/conftest.py`, adapting the expected module names to the selected tests and preserving existing hooks and imports:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys

import pytest


def pytest_sessionfinish(session, exitstatus):
    """Verify exercised API provenance without preloading application modules."""
    scratch_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]
    for name in ("youtube_whisperer.api.app",):
        module = sys.modules.get(name)
        if module is None:
            raise pytest.UsageError(f"Expected exercised module is absent: {name}")
        location = Path(module.__file__).resolve()
        if not location.is_relative_to(scratch_root):
            raise pytest.UsageError(f"Application import escaped scratch: {name}: {location}")
        print(f"ACTUAL_IMPORT_PROVENANCE {name}={location}")
```

List only modules the selected tests are expected to exercise; modules intentionally kept absent MUST remain absent. If tests unload or replace modules, check provenance immediately after the relevant test-controlled import instead of relying on the session-end hook. For test-spawned child processes, add equivalent scratch-only location checks inside each child after its own configuration setup and controlled imports. A parent pytest check does not certify a child's imports. From the scratch root, a focused API run is:

```bash
mkdir -p owned-temp
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 TMPDIR="$PWD/owned-temp" python -m pytest tests/api/test_app.py --no-cov --basetemp="$PWD/owned-temp/pytest"
```

A run failing the import check is invalid evidence, rather than a surviving or killed mutant. Save required evidence outside disposable scratch before cleanup. `PYTHONPATH` and owned temporary paths do not replace the test bootstrap's settings isolation or service doubles.

The focused command uses `--no-cov` because the repository's default pytest coverage threshold applies to the whole application. Preserve pytest-randomly's reported seed when reproducing a failure, and identify order-dependent results.
