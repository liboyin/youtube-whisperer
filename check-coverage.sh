# Run the test suite and enforce the coverage policy that AGENTS.md delegates to this script:
# statement and branch coverage must each reach the threshold for every measured file and for the
# project as a whole. coverage.py reports line coverage as statement coverage, so the two are one
# check here. pytest's own --cov-fail-under only guards the project total, which is why per-file
# enforcement lives here instead of in pyproject.toml.
#
# Usage: ./check-coverage.sh [pytest options...]
# Extra arguments are forwarded to pytest. Selecting a subset of tests makes the per-file gate
# meaningless, so pass options (e.g. -x, -q), not test paths.
#
# Environment:
#   COVERAGE_THRESHOLD  Minimum percentage per file and for the total. Defaults to 80.
